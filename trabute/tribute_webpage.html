<font color="blue">physics</font> and <font color="blue">aerospace engineering</font>. He spent the next four decades as a scientist and science
administrator, mainly at the<font color="blue"><u> Defence Research and Development Organisation</u></font> (DRDO) and <font color="blue"><u>Indian
 Space Research Organisation </u></font>(ISRO) and was intimately involved in India's civilian space
 programme and military <font color="blue">missile development efforts</font>.[1] He thus came to be known as the
 <em><b>Missile Man of India</b></em> for his work on the development of <font color="blue">ballistic missile</font> and <font color="blue">launch
 vehicle</font> technology.[2][3][4] He also played a pivotal organisational, technical, and
 political role in India's <font color="blue"><em>Pokhran-II</em></font> nuclear tests in 1998, the first since the <font color="blue">original
 nuclear test by India</font> in 1974.[5]
 <br>

Kalam <font color="blue">was elected</font> as the 11th president of India in 2002 with the support of both the
ruling <font color="blue">Bharatiya Janata Party</font> and the then-opposition <font color="blue">Indian National Congress</font>. Widely
referred to as the "<b>People's President</b>",[6] he returned to his civilian life of education,
 writing and public service after a single term. He was a recipient of several prestigious
 awards, including the <font color="blue">Bharat Ratna</font>, India's highest civilian honour.
 <br>
While delivering a lecture at the <font color="blue">Indian Institute of Management Shillong</font>, Kalam collapsed
and died from an apparent <font color="blue">cardiac arrest</font> on 27 July 2015, aged 83.[7] Thousands, including
national-level dignitaries, attended the funeral ceremony held in his hometown of <font color="blue">Rameswaram</font>,
where he was buried with <font color="blue">full state honours</font>.</p>

                ☛ In 1969, he moved to the Indian
                Space Research Organisation, where he
                was project director of the SLV-III, the
                first satellite launch vehicle that was
                both designed and produced in India.
                <br><br> ☛ Rejoining DRDO in 1982,
                Kalam planned the program that produced
                a number of successful missiles, which
                helped earn him the nickname <strong>
                    “Missile Man.”</strong>
                <br><br> ☛ Among those successes
                was Agni, India’s first intermediate-range

                aspects of the SLV-III and was launched
                in 1989.

                the country’s 1998 nuclear weapons tests
                solidified India as a nuclear power and
                established Kalam as a national hero,
                although the tests caused great concern
                in the international community.
                <br><br> ☛ In 1998 Kalam put
                forward a countrywide plan called

                a less-developed to a developed society
                in 20 years. The plan called for, among
                other measures, increasing agricultural
                productivity, emphasizing technology as
                a vehicle for economic growth, and

                    in 1981</b> and the <b>Padma Vibhushan
                    in 1990</b> for his work with ISRO and
